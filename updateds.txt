        <h2><em>What is Data Science?</em></h2>
        <p>
          Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific
          methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and
          insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge
          and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application
          domains.

        <h2><em>Applications Of Data Science:</em></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fraud and Risk Detection</li>
          <li>Healthcare</li>
          <li>Internet Search</li>
          <li>Targeted Advertising</li>

        <h2><em>Data Scientist role:</em></h2>
        <p>
          By extrapolating and sharing these insights, data scientists help
          organizations to solve vexing problems. Combining computer science,
          modeling, statistics, analytics, and math skills—along with sound
          business sense—data scientists uncover the answers to major questions
          that help organizations make objective decisions.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2><em>Advantages of Data Science:</em></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s in Demand</li>
          <p>
            Data Science is greatly in demand. Prospective job seekers have
            numerous opportunities. It is the fastest growing job on Linkedin
            and is predicted to create 11.5 million jobs by 2026. This makes
            Data Science a highly employable job sector.
          </p>
          <li>Abundance of Positions</li>
          <p>
            There are very few people who have the required skill-set to become
            a complete Data Scientist. This makes Data Science less saturated as
            compared with other IT sectors. Therefore, Data Science is a vastly
            abundant field and has a lot of opportunities. The field of Data
            Science is high in demand but low in supply of Data Scientists.
          </p>
          <li>A Highly Paid Career</li>
          <p>
            Data Science is one of the most highly paid jobs. According to
            Glassdoor, Data Scientists make an average of $116,100 per year.
            This makes Data Science a highly lucrative career option.
          </p>
          <li>Data Science is Versatile</li>
          <p>
            There are numerous applications of Data Science. It is widely used
            in health-care, banking, consultancy services, and e-commerce
            industries. Data Science is a very versatile field. Therefore, you
            will have the opportunity to work in various fields.
          </p>
          <li>Data Science Makes Data Better</li>
          <p>
            Companies require skilled Data Scientists to process and analyze
            their data. They not only analyze the data but also improve its
            quality. Therefore, Data Science deals with enriching data and
            making it better for their company.
          </p>
          <li>Data Scientists are Highly Prestigious</li>
          <p>
            Data Scientists allow companies to make smarter business decisions.
            Companies rely on Data Scientists and use their expertise to provide
            better results to their clients. This gives Data Scientists an
            important position in the company.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>Data Science vs Data Analytics</em></h2>
        <p>
          Data science is an umbrella term that encompasses data analytics, data
          mining, machine learning, and several other related disciplines. While
          a data scientist is expected to forecast the future based on past
          patterns, data analysts extract meaningful insights from various data
          sources. A data scientist creates questions, while a data analyst
          finds answers to the existing set of questions.
