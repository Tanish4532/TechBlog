            <p>
                Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Mobile app development is a process for building mobile applications that run on mobile devices. These applications can either be pre-installed or downloaded and installed by the user later. They use the network capabilities of the device to work computing resources remotely.

              <li>
                Choose One Major Platform. The major platforms in the mobile app development world are Android, iOS, and Windows.
                <p>The major platforms in the mobile app development world are Android, iOS, and Windows. There are others too like Symbian and Blackberry RIM, but you already know not to go for it.

                    So, either you can go for all the three major platforms, or you can choose one.
                    Even though Windows 10 apps are springing up, it’s still not the most lucrative to areas, to begin with.
                    
                    Thus, the first stepping stone for your journey to choosing will be either to opt for iOS apps or Android apps.
                    
                    Once you have control over one, you can expand your horizons to include other app development technologies too.</p>
              </li>
              Get the Required Training and Education. Getting formal training and education in software development processes is indeed required.
              <p>Getting formal training and education in software development processes is indeed required.

                A degree in computer science and software engineering is a good foundation because it helps you get a grasp on key concepts of data structuring, designing, and programming.
                
                But even if you have passed the graduation age and still struggling where to begin with, you can opt for online courses. There are several web platforms that offer online courses specifically in app development.</p>
             
              <li>
                Master These Three Areas.
                <p>Like any other discipline, app development requires you to take a stronghold on fundamentals. Here, the three core concepts are mobile user interface design, programming, and business expertise.</p>
              </li>


              <li>
                Mobile user interface design:
                <p>It all starts with the deIt’s not the programming language that matters the most. It’s your ability to make logic and translate those algorithms into efficient codes. The person who knows how programming works can pick up any language he wants.

                    You should have knowledge of programming if you want to develop a mobile app.
                    
                    However, you still need to learn a few languages to make it work.
                    
                    1. Classic object-oriented programming language: Java, C++, Objective C. For iOS, Apple’s own programming language Swift is also being widely accepted by app development companies.
                    
                    2. Front end: HTML5, CSS, and JavaScriptsign. There are beginners who complain when asked to learn the intricacies of the interface. But that’s the core of an app. Being able to code an interface sets a launchpad for your career growth trajectory.</p>

              <li>
                Practice Your Skills:
                <p>racticing is very important to keep your skills sharp. If you learn something but don’t end up practicing regularly, you might forget. This is why one should constantly practice coding, programming, and even development.</p>

              </li>
              

             <li> Apply for Internship</li>
              <p>The best part of an app development internship is you learn the processes by which a project is organized and implemented. You also get to work on projects throughout the app development cycle.

                An internship also serves as the recommendation for your first job as an app developer. So once you’re ready, log in to LinkedIn and start applying for intern positions.</p>
